This is a work in progress to upgrade MINIX PKGSRC to the latest 
quarterly available (2015QX).

I have rebased, squashed and edited commit message in order to facilitate
the next update, and have a clear focus from the commit message what we
need and why, at minimum.

Step 0: Those are changes which update the PKGSRC definition of the MINIX
        plateform. Those are required to even be able to start.

Step 1: those are the required package to bootstrap PKGSRC, and start pbulk
        builds.

Step 2:  - base tools: the actual tools we need for development on a regular
                       MINIX system.
         - base dep: Dependencies which are pulled in by the base tools.
                     This may change between each update, depending on the
                     versions of the tools.

Any package without a "Step X:" prefix is icing on the cake, and helps improve
the number of available packages on MINIX. They should not be considered as
blocking requirements for a new release.

Known Bugs
----------
 - When using bmake to compile a package by hand, sometimes the following
   variables need to be exported explicitly in the environment:   
     export STRIP=strip
     export CC=clang
     export CXX=clang++

 - Some package might fail because of coredumps or even during execution.
   In some cases, this is due to the use of both mthread and GNUÂ Pth.
   mthread might be pulled in as a dependency of libc++, and a few X11 libraries.
